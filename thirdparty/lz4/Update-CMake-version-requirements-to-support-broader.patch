Subject: [PATCH] Update CMake version requirements to support broader
 compatibility

This commit:
- Maintains CMake compatibility with older systems by keeping the minimum version at 3.5
- Sets the maximum policy version to 4.0.2 to ensure consistent behavior with newer CMake versions
- Adds a comment explaining the version range specification purpose
- Ensures future-proofing as newer CMake versions will use the 4.0.2 policy set
